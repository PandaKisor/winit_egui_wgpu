Create Framework.rs which will house the Winit/WGPU inititialization
    This will require the Lib.rs file to be restructured entirely,
        Lib needs to become the proper export it is meant to be.

https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/trunk/examples/src/main.rs

Other options of work needed to be done
Fully remove the leftover polygon code, specifically the rendering_style code

Get backend support for MacOS, will likely need to be after the lib/framework change
